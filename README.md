# Tic Tac Toe Game Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using OOP principles in C++.

## Description

The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid to try and achieve a winning pattern (three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) before the opponent does. Players take turns until one player wins, the game ends in a draw, or the grid is filled.

## Features

- Players can choose their symbols (e.g., 'X' or 'O').
- The game checks for win conditions after each move.
- If a player wins, the game announces the winner.
- If the game ends in a draw, it announces the draw.
- Players are prompted to input the position they want to mark on their turn.
- Positions on the board are validated to ensure they are not already occupied.

## Usage

1. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable file.
3. Enter the symbol for player 1 and player 2.
4. Players take turns entering the position to place their symbol.
5. The game ends when one player wins, the game ends in a draw, or the grid is filled.

## Installation

To play the game, you need to compile the source code using a C++ compiler. You can download and install a C++ compiler from various sources, such as GCC, Clang, or Visual C++.
